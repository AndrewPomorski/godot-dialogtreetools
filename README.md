# godot-dialogtreetools

Plugin for Godot Engine editor, allowing user to create dialog trees (for Adventure or RPG games) in the form of a Graph, attached to a custom node.

##Documentation

##Objectives

This project aims at providing a tool helping the creation of scripts defining the behaviour of NPC in adventure games (Point'n'click style) or RPGs. 

A tree defined with this tool can be used in multiple ways:
- either use the custom TreeNode node provided by the plugin, which comes with various methods for parsing.
- either save the node as a JSON file, which can then be used as a Resource file for user scripts (thus with a custom parsing).
